# Tutorials

I am dedicating this repository to all code I ~copy~ write from various tutorials I find. Following tutorials is a nice and easy way to gain a lot of different skills. It gets annoying when I have to find out where to store all these different snippets of tutorial code, so this repo will not be my tutorial repository.
